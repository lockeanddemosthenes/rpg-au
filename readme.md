This project primarily uses HTML/CSS and JQuery to display different characters' stats. Its purpose is to look cool and do nothing - at least, for now.

Images used are all created by Picrew user G0966 as hosted on Picrew (links below). As such, it is up to their discretion if I should remove the images.
